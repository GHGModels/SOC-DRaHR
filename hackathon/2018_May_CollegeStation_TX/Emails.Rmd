# Email sent out day before hackathon

Dear Data Hackers!

Welcome to the C-PEAT soil data hackathon. We are excited to see you tomorrow and wanted to pass along some links to help get you started.

First, we will be working to produce a harmonized data product over the next two days so you'll want to have a laptop with you. If you don't have a laptop don't worry, there will be folks there who you can pair up with. Don't forget your charging cable. 

Please install R, git, bash and nano; instructions at the bottom of this page https://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/ (there are also instructions for Python, SQLite, and OpenRefine that you can ignore).

The two main repositories we will be working with are here: https://github.com/ISCN/soilDataR and https://github.com/ISCN/SOC-DRaHR These links will be useful during the workshop but you don't need to do anything before hand with them.

We will start at 9AM in the OM building, in room 807 (on the 8th floor). Coffee, water, snacks, and lunch will be provided. 

Email us with any questions and we are looking forward to seeing everyone tomorrow!
